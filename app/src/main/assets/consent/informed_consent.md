Dear users:

**OmniTrack** is a mobile application that enables people to record various information in a flexible format by designing trackers. You can design a diary app that suits on your personal needs, or connect your fitness device to collect health data combined with your own inputs. Using features like shortcut panel and reminder alarms, OmniTrack helps you maintain tracking conveniently.

**OmniTrack** is a collaborative research project of Seoul National University, Microsoft Research, and the Pennsylvania State University.

Currently, we are conducting a deployment study under approval of the ethical review board of Seoul National University (IRB No. 1702/001-007).

In the study, we would like to scientifically assess, how people use flexible self-tracking tools like OmniTrack.

If you agree with this form, your **anonymized** usage data will be included to our statistical analysis dataset.

**The data will be anonymized so we cannot know that the data is yours.**

##### Data we will store for analysis
