### Informed Consent for Research Participation

Dear users:

**OmniTrack** is a collaborative research project of Seoul National University, Microsoft Research, and the Pennsylvania State University.

Currently, we are conducting a deployment study under approval of the ethical review board of Seoul National University (###########).

In the study, we would like to scientifically assess, how people use flexible self-tracking tools like OmniTrack. How many trackers do people create? What purposes do people use OmniTrack on? How many fields do people put in a single tracker? Do people frequently use OmniTrack?

If you agree with this form, your **anonymized** usage data will be included to our statistical analysis dataset.
Because you may concern about the private data on your smartphone, We will explain what data we will look into.
**The data will be anonymized so we cannot know that the data is yours.**

##### Data we will use
- **Basic identity** (gender, nationality, age, and occupation)
- **Name of the trackers**
- **Field information of the trackers**
- **Timestamps of the tracked items**
- **OmniTrack app sessions;** we record how long you've stayed in certain page in the OmniTrack application, to assess which feature that people use more frequently.

##### Data we will **NOT** use
- **Exact value of the tracked items** (e.g., The data you inserted directly such as the location you visited, and the time when you went to bed)
- **Any Information outside the OmniTrack app** (OmniTrack does not touch any private data on your smartphone)


#### Voluntary participation in the study
The participation in this study is voluntary and can be ended at any point in the time without giving reasons. You can uninstall the app at any point without any negative consequences. You can remove all your data provided to us in the app menu, and delete your account.
